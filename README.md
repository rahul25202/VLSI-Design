# CMOS Circuit Design and Simulation | Cadence Virtuoso, Xming, PuTTY.
-  Modeled and analyzed CMOS inverters using Cadence Virtuoso, optimizing propagation delay, power consumption,
and noise margins.
-  Designed and simulated logic gates (NAND, AND, NOR, OR, XOR, XNOR), Flip-Flops, and Latches, ensuring
compliance with DRC LVS validation.
-  Explored supply voltage process variations to optimize performance under varying load capacitances switching
frequencies..
